# 2019 Updated README
## Will include local installation and AmazonAWS

## Amazon AWS
1. Connect to server
The AWS server restricts access to certain IP addresses. If you can identify the IP addresses used by your university VPN, 
John Kunze can have them added so that you can ssh into the server.

On your own VPN, in your terminal session, enter the following command:

$ ssh yamz@ids-yamz2-dev.yamz.net
